üîç Credit Risk Modeling with XGBoost and Optuna
This project builds a robust credit risk classification model using machine learning techniques, specifically the XGBoost classifier. The notebook walks through a complete end-to-end pipeline ‚Äî from preprocessing and SMOTE-based class balancing to hyperparameter optimization using Optuna. The goal is to predict the likelihood of loan default based on applicant characteristics.

Key components:

Exploratory Data Analysis and feature selection

Handling class imbalance with SMOTE

Model training using XGBClassifier

Hyperparameter tuning with Optuna to maximize macro F1-score

Cross-validation to ensure robust performance

This project demonstrates how to build interpretable, high-performance models for financial risk applications, blending domain understanding with ML best practices. Ideal for anyone interested in fintech, credit scoring, or practical applications of hyperparameter optimization.
